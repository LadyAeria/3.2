# How are you Feeling?
This short and simple rpg-like game is a user interaction with five characters depicting the stages of grief. We all go through these stages at some point of our life whether they're in the given order or at random stages. This was created to give people an understanding of how a person would be reacting or saying within a certain stage.

I plan to make an rpg-like game where you interact with characters with different stages/conditions/settings (based on the five stages of grief or focus on different disabilities)

Week 1: Research games for inspiration for 3.0 project.

Week 2: Familiarize with some of the libraries in p5.js that I plan to use 
        Using clickable library for clickable character interactions

Week 3: Create three separate game screens under said conditions
        Make Start, Clickable characters, and close up interaction screen
        A lot of trial and error tests to make the code work

Week 4: Finalize and add characters, make better visuals for the game
