# 3.2

Week 1: Research games for inspiration for 3.0 project.
        Plan to make an rpg-like game where you interact with characters with different stages/conditions/settings (based on the five stages of grief or focus on different disabilities)

Week 2: Familiarize with some of the libraries in p5.js that I plan to use 
        Using clickable library for clickable character interactions

Week 3: Create three separate game screens under said conditions
        Make Start, Clickable characters, and close up interaction screen

Week 4: Finalize and add characters, make better visuals for the game
